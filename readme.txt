#### Sidebars

-   Atlas – Category Sidebar ( shows on Atlas category page )
-   Atlas – Search Result Sidebar ( shows on Atlas search result list )
-   Atlas – Home Sidebar ( shows on Atlas knowledge base home page )

#### Widgets

-   Popular Articles

-   Newest Articles
-   Newest In Category
-   Recently Updated In Category
-   Recently Viewed

**NOTE!** Sidebars and widgets work with the Startup frontend style.

**NOTE!** Currently, Atlas supports only one category level, we believe that’s a better user experience for both frontend users and admin editors.

Categories do have three extra custom fields that are being used within the frontend (Color, Font Icon, and Image). **NOTE!** To use font icons with categories make sure you enable FontAwesome from the settings page.

#### Prioritizing user experience on your knowledgebase page

-   Purposeful information ( Ensure the questions and answers shown are providing value to the users to make decisions about your product )
-   Contact or support options ( If a user doesn’t have their problem solved or a question answered, offer a method for them to directly contact you )
